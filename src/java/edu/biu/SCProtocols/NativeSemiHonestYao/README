INTRODUCTION
------------

This protocol is a wrapper for native implementation of semi honest Yao protocol.

Since native implementation is more efficient than a java implementation, we chose to have along with the existing 
java implementation, a wrapper to an implementation in c++. This way one can compare between the implementations and 
take the one he prefer. 


EXECUTION
---------
The wrapper has one class for offline protocol and one for online protocol. 
The protocol should get as parameter the YaoProtocolInput, which contains:
1. Party id (1 or 2). According to the party id, the protocols execute the appropriate party.
2. A config file that contains the protocol configuration. It configure: 
	* Protocol's parametrs (ips and ports of the protocol parties, circuit name, etc.)
	* Additional input files (circuits, inputs)
Detailed information of the config file will be mentioned later.

In order to run the protocol:
1. Open a terminal for each party
2. Navigate to the bin directory of scapi
3. Run 
~ java -Djava.library.path="..\scapi\assets\x64Dlls" edu.biu.SCProtocols.NativeSemiHonestYao.YaoParty 1 ..\scapi\src\java\edu\biu\SCProtocols\NativeSemiHonestYao\YaoConfig.txt
This executes party one of the protocol, using the config file supplied by scapi.
In order to execute the other party one should change the id parameter. The config file remains the same.

The output is printed to the screen.

CONFIG FILE
------------
The format of the config file is as follows:
	number_of_iterations = [..]
	print_output = [..]
	sender_ip = [..]
	receiver_ip = [..]
	input_section = [..]
	circuit_type = [..]
	
	# OS name is added automatically
	[AES-Linux]
	circuit_file = [..]
	input_file_party_1 = [..]
	input_file_party_2 = [..]
	
	[AES-Windows]
	circuit_file = [..]
	input_file_party_1 = [..]
	input_file_party_2 = [..]
    	
An example of config file:

	number_of_iterations = 1000
	print_output = false
	sender_ip = 127.0.0.1
	receiver_ip = 127.0.0.1
	input_section = AES 
	circuit_type = NoFixedKey
	
	# OS name is added automatically
	[AES-Linux]
	circuit_file = ../../samples/assets/circuits/AES/NigelAes.txt
	input_file_party_1 = ../../samples/assets/circuits/AES/AESPartyOneInputs.txt
	input_file_party_2 = ../../samples/assets/circuits/AES/AESPartyTwoInputs.txt
	
	[AES-Windows]
	circuit_file = ../scapi/src/java/edu/biu/SCProtocols/NativeSemiHonestYao/NigelAes.txt
	input_file_party_1 = ../scapi/src/java/edu/biu/SCProtocols/NativeSemiHonestYao/AESPartyOneInputs.txt
	input_file_party_2 = ../scapi/src/java/edu/biu/SCProtocols/NativeSemiHonestYao/AESPartyTwoInputs.txt
